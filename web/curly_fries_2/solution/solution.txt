Solution:
  1. The website shows a pictures of the xbox logo and the linux penguin
  2. Send a request while changing the 'User Agent' header to include both 'Xbox' and 'Linux' and the flag will be displayed
  3. If you send a request with only one but not the other, only the missing one will be displayed.
