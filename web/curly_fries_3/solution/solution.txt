Solution:
  0. The main thing to do, is just follow the clues with the headers here
  1. GET request won't work here, so try POST next
  2. Hint: 'perhaps try Googling me instead?'
    Change 'Referer' to 'https://www.google.com'
  3. Hint: 'did you attend that lovely dinner party Hosted by dscvit?'
    Change 'Host' to contain 'dscvit' (eg: dscvit.com)
  4. Hint: 'potates and carrots are my friends, milk and Cookies will be my end'
    Run curl with -v to make it verbose. You'll see there's a cookie {user: anon}
    Change the user to 'root' (implied by potatoes and carrots)
  5. Hint: 'JFATHER, JMOTHER, JDAUGHTER, ____?'
    Change 'Content-Type' to 'application/json'
  6. Hint: "{'error': 'json data missing'}"
    Include empty data {} in the parameters
  7. Hint: "{'error': {'messi': 'required'}}"
    Include data {'messi':''} as a parameter
  8. Hint: "{'error': {'messi': 'which club am i at?'}}"
    Include data {'messi':'psg'} or {'messi':'paris'} as a parameter
  9. The flag is yours

curl -v -H 'Referer: https://www.google.com' -H 'Host: dscvit.com' -b user=root -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"messi":"psg"}' -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000
