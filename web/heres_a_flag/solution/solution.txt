flag = dsc{welcome_to_deconstructf}

Solution:
  1. Inspect element and check out the "contain-flag" class.
  2. In the css, you can see the ::after pseudo-class of this element.
  3. There's a property for a caesar-cipher counter and the encrpyted flag.
  4. Change the '0' to 'o' and run it through a decoder to get the final flag.
