We see **Social Street** on one on the hanging lamps. We extract the Exifdata of this image to get the properties of the image. We get Geo-coordinates for the same. Upon entering them on Google Maps, we get a location in Saket, with a cafe called Social Street. It has a very cool wall graffiti on google.

Since we are given in the hint they post on social media, we find its Instagram page and find the image of the same graffiti. Under its comments we see a cipher text. As mentioned in the description, we get a hint that its a XOR substitution. the key for the same is the build which is **oneplus** which on solving on CyberChef gives us the flag.
