  Around 5 years ago, I made this <b>killer</b> program that encodes the string into a cyphertext. The unique feature 
  of this program is that for the <i>same exact</i> plaintext, it generates a <i>different</i> cyphertext every time 
  you run the program. Yesterday I was nosing around in some old stuff and found an encrypted message!
  <div style="background-color: #eee;border: 1px solid #999;display: block;padding: 20px;">

  </div>
  Sadly I realized that I lost the decryption program. I have the encryption program though. Do you think you can help 
  me out and decrypt this message for me?
