# Code Decode

**Author**: Anish Raghavendra

Difficulty: Hard

Description:
Around 5 years ago, I made this <b>killer</b> program that encodes the string into a cyphertext. The unique feature
of this program is that for the <i>same exact</i> plaintext, it generates a <i>different</i> cyphertext every time
you run the program. Yesterday I was nosing around in some old stuff and found an encrypted message!

Sadly I realized that I lost the decryption program. I have the encryption program though. Do you think you can help
me out and decrypt this message for me?

Given to User:

    Cypher.txt
    Encrypted_text.txt
    encrypter.py
