        Hello Agent,<br/>
        Professor **\<REDACTED\>**, has created a machine called the `Destructinator` (Details are confidential) that would give our agency a huge advantage.<br/>
        But unfortunately, he has accidentally set the device to fire in `24` Hours and has forgotten the password to disable it.
        If it fires the results would be catastrophic.<br/>
        Your mission is to hack pass the password barrier and shutdown the destructinator.<br/> <br/>
        The login portal details and source code of the login have been provided for you.
