        Hello Agent,<br/>
        I apologize for the unusual time of this mission but this mission is takes high priority <br/>
        I have accidentally locked myself in my office and the password that I have set for my office door does not work<br/>
        I assume that one of the janitors have accidentally reset the password<br/>
        Your mission is to unlock my office door<br/><br/>
        Unfortunately the program that unlocks the door is not exposed to the network but there is another record keeping program that is exposed to the network and runs on the same machine.<br/>
        The connection info for the record keeper and the source code is included below.
