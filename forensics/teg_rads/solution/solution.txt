flag = dsc{publ1c_d15pl4y_0f_ff3ct10n_b4nn3d}

Solution:
  0. Line 420 of the raw data says there are 5 pieces to the puzzle
  1. The first part is located at line 69, which tells you not to escape from javascript.
    This implies running unescape() in javascript.
    unescape("%64%73%63%7B%70%75%62%6C%31%63_")
    Run it to get: 'dsc{publ1c_'
  2. The second part is again js, located after the EOF, i.e. right at the end
    (23958575899).toString(35) + String.fromCharCode(0x5F)
    Run it to get: 'd15pl4y_'
  3. The third part is in Keywords but wont be found by looking at properties
    At properties, Keywords says (third section should be right here), so keep looking
    CTRL+F to look for this and you'll find Keywords: (110000 1100110 1011111)
    Convert from binary to decimal to ASCII to get '0f_'
  4. If you unzip the file or use winRar or whatever, you'll find p4.txt
    It says Caesar wasn't smart enough, implying a vigenere decode
    It also says the key is our creator which in the metadata is "alexa"
    Use this to get 'ff3ct10n_'
  5. The original hint says that "...producers always get the final say"
    Decrypt the base64 in the Producer metatag to get 'b4nn3d}'
  6. Put it all together to get your flag.
