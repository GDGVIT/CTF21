description: >
    It's been a year since you've been a private investigator and you've made quite a name for yourself. You sit there thinking
    about all the weird cases you've managed in the last year when suddenly, a person bursts through your door saying something
    about her missing husband. You finally gather that her husband, a renowned journalist who was tracking down a serial killer
    has suddenly gone missing since last night. The hysterical wife has provided you with a picture of how he looks like. Do you
    take the case?
